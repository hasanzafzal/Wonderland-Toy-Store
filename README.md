Wonderland Toy store – Online Inventory, Ordering & Management System
Narrative Description of the Website & Problem Addressed:
“Wonderland Toystore” is a local retail shop facing operational delays due to manual inventory
tracking and sales processing. The absence of an online presence restricts their market reach. This
project proposes an Object-Oriented Python Flask-based web application that digitizes inventory
management, enables online ordering, and supports multiple toy categories such as electronic toys,
plush toys, and board games with distinct attributes.
The application will adopt software construction principles including abstraction, encapsulation, low
coupling, high cohesion, and modularization. The final system will automate workflows, reduce
errors, and provide a modern online storefront.
